Q1. Stack Experiments (30 Points):
----------------------------------

1.1. The result is 7.0 (for correct answer input would have to be 
	 (2+(3+4))
	 Ops Stack contains ["+"] (first value pushed into the ops stack)
	 Vals stack contains [2.0] (first value pushed into the vals stack)


1.2. The result is 7.0 (even though the expression is not formated correctly 
	 it will still give the correct result given the fact that it only
	 pops one of the "-"from the ops stack.
	 The operations stack still contains the first ["-"] operator. 
	 The vals stack is empty.
	 
1.3. Result : 99.0 ( closing parentheses was never found so the content
	 of the ops stack is never popped)
	 Ops Stack contains "-".
	 Vals Stack is empty

1.4.Result: 1.75 (given the format the only operation that actually 
	executes is (7 / 4) 
	Ops stack ["+", "*"] with * being at the bottom of the stack
	Vals stack [2.0, 2.0]

1.5. Resut : 4.625 (Correct result, input properly formated)  
	 OPs stack is empty []
	 Vals stack is empty  []                                                

1.6. See evaluate.java, added % and ceiling as operations to be pushed to the stack 
	 when found. Also added their respective operation inside the closing parentheses
	 operations 

1.7. Result : 2.0
	 Ops stack empty []
	 Vals stack empty []

3.1 Enter formula for computing number of array inspections for UnknownArraySolution

   f(n) = [[(n^2)(n^2 + 1)]/2] + [(n^2 - n^3)(n^2)]  

3.2 Enter formula for computing number of array inspections for ImprovedUnknownArraySolution

   g(n) = [N^3 -2(n^2)][n^2 -1] + [(n^4 + n^2)/2] + n^2
